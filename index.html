    <hr>
    <h4><p style="margin:20px 100px;">Born and raised in South Africa, Musk spent time in Canada before moving to the United States. Educated at the
        University
        of Pennsylvania in physics and business, Musk started getting his feet wet as a serial tech entrepreneur with
        early
        successes like Zip2 and X.com, which merged with a company that became PayPal.High-stakes risk has been a
        hallmark of Elon Musk's career:
        defying industry standards with reusable rockets at his $210 billion interplanetary exploration company
        SpaceX—or, at $1 trillion Tesla,
        spending billions on titanic production facilities to manufacture electric-vehicle components in-house.Elon Musk
        is one of the wealthiest people in the world,
        with an estimated net worth of US $314 billion as of November 2024, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires
        Index, and $300.3 billion according to Forbes, primarily
        from his ownership stakes in Tesla, Inc. and SpaceX. Elon Musk's resume achievements and skills go beyond
        founding and leading innovative companies. His approach to leadership
        and project management is characterized by ambitious goals, strategic decision-making, and the ability to
        inspire and motivate teams.</p></h4>
